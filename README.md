# Digital Filters

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) in a simplified way is how computers which are in their majority digital interact with the world making data acquisition and processing it to obtein more objective information.
Digital filters are a key part of DSP where the data is adjusted to 

There are multiple types of filters that are divided into different categories and applied to multiple applications.
The FIR and IIR filters are the most common different types where filters are initial divided and we will have this separation also done in this library.

This library will have different architecture of digital filters, not only enabling fast processing, but also providing information on the different architecture trade-offs as performance metrics of the filters, area and power consumption.

Need to create initial filers and check-in
